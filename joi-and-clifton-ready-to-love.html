And then Truth or Dare happened and let everyone know what we already knew. Then we had the retreat where it all went down again because some people still didn’t understand our love for each other,” he added. “That’s why I asked you here today because I choose you.”</p><p>He then held out a cardboard sign that read, “Choose me, circle yes or no” before showing Joi another sign that said, “Will work for food.”</p><p>Joi circled “yes” and despite the impending distance between them, she said that she was ready for love with Clifton.</p><p>It’s been a very long time since I’ve had someone treat me with such care, tenderness, and butt grabs,” said Joi. “From the beginning, I saw a best friend in you, someone I can be silly with, someone I can rest my burdens on. In your arms, I feel safe. […]</p><p>“I chose you from the first day,” she added.</p><p>In a confessional, Clifton added that he was thankful to Tommy for the opportunity to meet the “love of his life.”</p><p>“Here I am in heaven,” said Clifton.</p><p>These two are TOO cute!</p><p>Things are looking up for these two, so much so that they recently revealed their matching King and Queen tattoos on their hand.</p><p>Joi also hinted that she’s been rocking Clifton’s chain.</p><p>It’s unclear if they’re currently together in Mexico or dating long distance.</p><p>We’ll have to tune in to see more Joi and Clifton when part 1 of the Ready To Love Reunion air<strong>s Friday, April 29 at 8/9 c on OWN.</strong> Until then, it looks like the Internet will keep melting into <a href=#>heart eye goo</a> over this couple’s cuteness.</p><p>What do YOU think about Joi and Clifton from OWN’s “Ready To Love”?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo6aiZZGjsW6vy6KdraeeYr%2BmrcOyZK2nXaG8t7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
