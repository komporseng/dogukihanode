Soon after the first season ended, Grace and Jackson confirmed their real-life relationship. In between the seasons, Grace and Jackson have been very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public about their relationship</a> and attended various events together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Additional cast members who are expected to be back include <strong>Catherine Missal</strong> as Bree, <strong>Spencer House</strong> as Wrigley, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sonia Mena</strong></a> as Pippa, <strong>Branden Cook</strong> as Evan, <strong>Benjamin Wadsworth </strong>as Drew, and <strong>Alicia Crowder</strong> as Diana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gossip Girl alum <strong>Thomas Doherty</strong> has joined the cast in a recurring role. He’ll play Leo, a junior at Baird who returns to campus after studying abroad for a year and finds himself immediately drawn to Lucy. He is seemingly as kind as he is charming, but Lucy isn’t sure whether she can fully trust him. Leo will eventually become entangled in the web created by Lucy and Stephen’s toxic relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thomas-doherty-tell-me-lies.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Lucifer star <strong>Tom Ellis</strong> has joined the season 2 cast as a series regular. According to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>, Tom will play Oliver, a “professor at Baird College whose tough love attitude makes him an intimidating presence that isn’t appreciated by all students. He is married to Lucy’s professor Marianne, but as one of the main characters begins seeking his approval, his influence will have chaotic repercussions.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tom is married to Tell Me Lies showrunner <strong>Meaghan Oppenheimer</strong>. He’s also teaming up with his wife and Tell Me Lies executive producer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a> on another Hulu show called Second Wife. Tom and Emma will star in and executive produce the series. Meaghan created the series and will serve as the showrunner.</p><h2>What Happened at the End of ‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 1?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tell Me Lies season 1 ended with a number of cliffhangers. At the end of the 2008 school year, Lucy and Stephen’s relationship is hanging by a thread. Macy’s death has cast a huge cloud over everyone. Stephen and Diana have a chat at an end-of-year party, and she invites him to work at her dad’s firm in New York City for the summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>After being humiliated by Lucy earlier in the season, Diana gets the last laugh. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stephen and Diana get back together</a> and parade their reunion in front of Lucy at the party. Lucy finds comfort in Evan, Bree’s boyfriend, and she wakes up in bed with him the next morning.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The show flashes forward to Evan and Bree’s engagement party in 2015. Evan drops a hint that Drew may have died in the aftermath of Macy’s death. Lucy crosses paths with Stephen at the party, and viewers learn that Stephen is engaged to Lucy’s best friend Lydia.</p><h2>What Will Happen in ‘Tell Me Lies’ Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Hollywood Life</strong> spoke exclusively with the Tell Me Lies showrunner about the game-changing finale and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>what’s to come in season 2</a>. She revealed that Bree does “not” know about Lucy and Evan sleeping together all those years ago, so that hookup could come back to haunt them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tell-me-lies-season-2-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Meaghan also teased that season 2 will feature a “much more vulnerable Lucy. I think she’s been drinking the Kool-Aid and has been under this spell of having Stephen beside her and feeling kind of powerful. I think a lot of her own mistakes will be very clear to her at the beginning of season 2 of how much she has hurt people that actually were good to her. I think we will be finding probably a kinder, softer Lucy because I think she’s a kind person. She has walls up, and she’s a mess sometimes, but I don’t think she’s inherently cruel. I think she became cruel because of Stephen.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The EP noted that season 2 would likely “explore some of Stephen and Lucy’s romantic lives away from each other, or at least part of the time. They wouldn’t be together at the beginning of the season. I think it would be really interesting to see a new love interest come in for Lucy that was messed up and complicated in very different ways and see her try to unlearn some of the behavior that she learned from Stephen and probably fail to unlearn those things. But I do think there will be some rage there, and there will absolutely be some revenge plots that happen at some point.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Oeo6VlnZp6rbXErGSsnZGovK95kWZsa2xmZoVyew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
