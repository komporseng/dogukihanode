Relationship &amp;amp; Net Worth</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-04</div><p><strong>Diana Avsaragova</strong> is a Russian MMA fighter, and many people want to know more about <strong>Diana Avsaragova’s Boyfriend</strong>. Diana will compete against Alejandra Lara on February 4, 2023 at Bellator 290. She competes in the Bellator MMA Women’s Flyweight division.</p><p>In December 2017, Jojua contested for the Emir Fighting title belt, and she successfully convinced the promoters to add Avsaragova to the event. Everyone was content. Alina Makarova, a debutante, was matched with a former wrestler who had previously participated in the contests. Makarova lasted a little over two minutes before succumbing to an armbar.</p><p>Diana looked to have a bright career after such an outstanding performance. However, she had a knee injury soon after and was forced to retire from competitive athletics until 2019. Following her rehabilitation and training, Diana participated in a complete three-round fight with Anna Lurchenkova in the Titan Global Championship. Following another victory, the Nart native was assigned a manager who began seeking lucrative options for her. She earned a bronze medal in the girls’ up to 60 kg freestyle wrestling event at the 2014 and 2015 Russian championships.</p><h2>Diana Avsaragova’s Boyfriend: Who Is She With?</h2><p>Diana seems to be a bit private about her details, such as <strong>Diana Avsaragova’s Boyfriend</strong>, since she has not stated anything about it.&nbsp;She also hasn’t uploaded a single image of her partner on any of her social media platforms, including Instagram, therefore no reliable information was gleaned from there.&nbsp;Nonetheless, Diana is a lovely lady, making it difficult to think she is unmarried, but the absence of proof about her lover suggests otherwise.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Diana-Avsaragova-1.jpg alt="Diana Avsaragova" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, she may be keeping her boyfriend’s name hidden since not everyone enjoys being in the limelight, and <strong>Diana Avsaragova’s Boyfriend</strong> might be one of them. Diana was born on August 7, 1998, in Ardon, North Ossetia. Her father wrestled, but a knee injury caused him to quit early.&nbsp;Diana’s mother suggested she take up wrestling as a youngster since Diana’s mother had also aspired to pursue a career in sports. Her family, however, had barred her from doing so. Avsaragova participated in both the junior and adult classes of the Moscow championships for weights up to 63 kg and under.&nbsp;The athlete was even taken to Canada, where she was also successful.</p><h2>Diana Avsaragova’s Net Worth In 2024</h2><p>Diana has also not disclosed her precise net worth to her supporters at the time of writing this article, therefore an exact figure is unavailable. Her projected net worth as of 2024 is more than $2 million, according to several sources. This information, however, has yet to be verified by the combatant herself. Despite her wealth, Diana does not seem to love spending money on things like vehicles, fancy watches, and designer shoes, since she has not uploaded a single image of herself flaunting them.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Diana-Avsaragova-2.jpg alt="Diana Avsaragova" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Diana’s Instagram account is @pantera_57_, and she had over 333k followers at the time of writing this post.&nbsp;She typically publishes images of herself and other people having fun on holidays, as well as sponsored posts and photos with her friends and family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibopmelnqiwtKaqZqfn6uubq7Osp2roZWjsW610maqoZ1dma61tc2gZJqmqaS7pnnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
