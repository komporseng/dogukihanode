Family And Nationality</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-25</div><p><strong>Demetrius Andrade’s Ethnicity: </strong>He is from the African island country of Cabo Verde. Andrade applied for dual citizenship in 2020 and may now continue to serve the United States alongside Cabo Verde. For professional boxer Demetrius Andrade, a vacation to Portugal changed everything. Following his visit to the European country, the 35-year-old has made every effort to engage with the people of Cabo Verde.</p><p>Andrade, who was born and reared in Rhode Island, had little impact from his ancestors. Only as he got older did Andrade realize the value of having the support of your community. One of the reasons Andrade wanted to reconnect with his origins was seeing how passionate Mexicans and Dominicans are about their boxers.&nbsp;Demetrius will now hope that his Cabo Verde neighborhood will be the loudest when he faces undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David “El Monstruo” Benavidez on November 25.</p><h2>Demetrius Andrade Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Demetrius Andrade’s ethnicity</strong> is not difficult to determine, since the professional boxer is proud of his background. Several photos of Demetrius carrying the Cabo Verde flag may be seen on his Instagram account.&nbsp;Demetrius Andrade was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, but he has made an effort to keep connected to his origins. Earlier this year, on July 5, Demetrius Andrade tweeted a message wishing Cape Verdeans a “Happy Independence Day.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Demetrius-Andrade-1.jpg alt="Demetrius Andrade" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Demetrius</strong> said in an interview that Rhode Island did not have a big Cape Verdean community and that he grew up largely among Dominicans. During the conversation, the boxer expressed a desire to reconnect with his ancestors after his time in Portugal. Andrade said that watching individuals speak the Cape Verdean Creole language and being unable to interact with them piqued his interest in his culture.</p><p>Andrade went on to say that when he returned to the United States after his vacation to Portugal, he questioned his father why he didn’t teach him Creole. Demetrius has worked hard since then to discover more about his ethnic background.&nbsp;Last year, the former WBO light middleweight champion even visited Cabo Verde for a seven-part series. Demetrius’ father, Paul, accompanied him on the trip, and the two met Cabo Verde’s Ambassador to Portugal.&nbsp;Paul said that his parents were born in Cabo Verde, although he was born and reared in the United States. Andrade said that his journey was solely for the aim of uplifting the Cabo Verde community.</p><h2>Demetrius Andrade Nationality</h2><p><strong>Demetrius Andrade</strong> has previously represented the United States at the international level. However, in 2020, he said that he holds dual citizenship.&nbsp;Demetrius told Chachi Carvalho that he now had dual citizenship and had visited with Cabo Verde’s Prime Minister. Demetrius was also awarded the 1st Degree of the Sports Merit medal by the Cabo Verde government in 2021.&nbsp;The event took place at the Government Palace, and the boxer was presented by Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva.</p><p>During his address, Demetrius expressed his pride in representing his nation and expressed his desire to repay Cabo Verdeans’ affection by visiting all of the islands. And Demetrius attempted to do so in his seven-part series.&nbsp;Demetrius previously represented the United States at the World Championship, where he earned a gold medal. He also competed for the United States at the 2007 Pan American Games, where he earned a silver medal in the Welterweight division, losing the gold to Pedro Lima.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Demetrius-Andrade-2.jpg alt="Demetrius Andrade" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Demetrius was one of the boxers that represented the United States in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. However, things did not go well for the fighter, who ended up criticizing the judges for his terrible performance.&nbsp;Andrade was defeated 11-9 by South Korean Kim Jungjoo in the quarter-finals, resulting in Team USA’s worst-ever Olympic boxing finish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibnqWVqb%2BqwdJmmKecopaxpnnWoqKiZaedrrW%2FjKGgrGWVqbWvtcKiq7Jllpa6qrjYZpinnF2jrrW1zqeYpaGkrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
