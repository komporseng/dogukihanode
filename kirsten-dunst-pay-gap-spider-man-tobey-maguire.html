I was just like, ‘Oh yeah, Tobey is playing Spider-Man.'” She quipped, “But you know who was on the cover of the second Spider-Man poster? Spider-Man and ME.” During the interview, she also recalled a Spider-Man producer taking her to get her teeth fixed at the age of 19 for the role.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The star said she was unaware of the plan until her car arrived at the dentist’s office. She declined the procedure, thank you very much. “I was like, ‘Mmmmm, no, I like my teeth,’” Kirsten told the outlet, adding that <strong>Sofia Coppola</strong>, her director on The Virgin Suicides, “loved” her teeth. The actress credited the director for instilling confidence in her at a young age. “The fact that the coolest girl liked how I looked, that’s what preserved me,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kirsten-Dunst-Pay-Gap-Tobey-Maguire-Spiderman-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kirsten continued, “She made me feel pretty. As a 16-year-old girl, you feel like crap about yourself, right? So to have my first experience of a more ‘sexy’ role be through her eyes gave me a confidence that helped me deal with a lot of other things.” Despite the pay disparity and teeth procedural requests, the Golden Globe-nominated actress still looks back at her time as Mary Jane with fondness.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kirsten recently revealed that she <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>would be open to reprising her role</a>, 14 years later. At the premiere of her upcoming film The Power of the Dog on Nov. 11, Kirsten told Variety when asked if she’d be open to returning to that superhero world: “I would do it. Why not? That would be fun. I would never say no to something like that.” She joked, “I’d be old MJ at this point with little Spidey babies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5BvZqShoqjBprqMnaynq6RivaLFjKCYqWWjpbalsdFmpJqmXam8o7HYZqSan6Wev6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
