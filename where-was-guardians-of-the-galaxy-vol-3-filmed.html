The superhero movie mainly unfolds in different galaxies as the Guardians move through the vast space to fight against the evil force threatening to destroy the world. So, you are bound to be curious about the actual filming sites of the Marvel flick.</p><h2>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Filming Locations</h2><p>‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ was filmed in Georgia and seemingly in England, specifically in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area and London. Initially, the plan was to start shooting the movie in January or February 2019, but that was before James Gunn’s firing. After that, it was scheduled to begin in February 2021, yet it didn’t fall through either.</p><p>So, after months of delay, principal photography for the Chris Pratt starrer reportedly commenced in November 2021 under the working title ‘Hot Christmas’ and wrapped up in early May 2022. So, let’s not waste time and follow the Guardians on their intergalactic journey and get a detailed account of all the specific locations that appear in the action movie!</p><h2>Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia</h2><p>Almost all of ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3′ was lensed in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. The filming unit set up camp in the metropolitan region’s cultural, demographic, and economic center, Atlanta. However, they mainly utilized the facilities of Trilith Studios, which served as the primary production location for the movie. Moreover, the interior of the Guardians’ new ship, the Bowie, was a four-story set the production team built together.</p><p>Situated at<span class=w8qArf>&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">461 Sandy Creek Road in the city of Fayetteville, the film studio is spread across nearly 1,000 acres, including 24 different sound stages, multiple workshops, production offices, backlots, and studio vendors. All these amenities and features make Trilith Studios a suitable filming site for various projects, especially superhero movies and TV shows. Over the years, it has hosted the production of ‘<a href=#>Black Adam</a>,’ ‘<a href=#>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>,’ ‘<a href=#>The Suicide Squad</a>,’ ‘<a href=#>Captain America: Civil War</a>,’ ‘The Falcon and the Winter Solider,’ and ‘<a href=#>Ms. Marvel</a>.’ </span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">The production team supposedly also visited other locales of Fayetteville for the shooting of ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.’&nbsp;</span></p><p>Several portions of the movie were taped in and around Atlanta Country Club at 500 Atlanta Country Club Drive in the city of Marietta. The filming unit reportedly decorated a nearby neighborhood and some parts of the Atlanta Country Club entrance with Christmas decorations and some lights for recording a few parts. According to reports, the filming on location also involved night shoots with a police car getting destroyed.</p><p>In March 2022, locals and passersby spotted the cast and crew members lensing numerous prominent portions in and around Believe Music Hall at 181 Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard in Atlanta. Reportedly, they even spent a couple of weeks shooting some important scenes in Clayton County.</p><h2>London, England</h2><p>Additional portions of ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ were taped in London, the capital of England as well as the United Kingdom. As per reports, the production team traveled to the Big Smoke in late 2021 and shot several pivotal sequences, mainly outdoors. Hence, you might spot some iconic landmarks and sites in the backdrop of a few scenes, including London Bridge, Southbank Centre, Tower of London, Somerset House, and Big Ben.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmsKCVp7Juw8CsZKCtkaexqq3NrGSonl2ptaZ5xpqjmrCpYsOwuIxsZJ%2BhnKKypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
