But how does the rest of the world—specifically the animals of the world—celebrate Valentine’s Day? Well, it’s complicated.</p><p>In the animal kingdom, love and sex are just as complex and mysterious as they are for humans. Some animals enter into long-term relationships (and short-term flings!), others engage in silly mating rituals, and a few have evolved to wield some incredibly bizarre sexual organs. Check out these 21 animal facts about love, sex, relationships, and reproduction:</p><p>1. Albatrosses are known for being flirtatious. Check out their hilarious mating dance:</p><p>2. When houseflies mate, the buzzing sound from their wings is so loud that they risk catching the attention of predators—especially bats.</p><p>3. Elephants have the longest gestation period of any land animal—up to 23 months. Oh, and babies weigh about 230 pounds at birth. Imagine carrying that around all day.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-42723 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/animal-love-facts-adorable-elephants.jpg alt="Interesting Animal Facts" width=800 height=679 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-42723 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Roo Howar Yoga</a></p><p>4.

While reproductive suicide is fairly common in plants, invertebrates and some fish species, its presence is extremely rare in mammals.</p><p>15. An opossum’s pregnancy only lasts 14 days.</p><p>16. Virgin honey bee queens mate early in life and only attend one mating flight. Since they can store millions of sperm in their oviducts, once is always enough.</p><p>17. Male and female zebrafish change colors when they mate.</p><p>18. About 90 percent of all birds are socially monogamous, but that doesn’t keep them from getting around. While monogamous birds live and raise offspring with their partners, they often have sex with various others.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-42728 alt="Swan Facts" width=800 height=534 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/animal-love-facts-swans.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-42728 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>imgarcade</a></p><p>19.

Shingleback skinks (Tiliqua rugosa) pair up at the end of the spring, and spend a couple months together before mating. Though they live separately for the rest of the year (females are left to raise the offspring), these skinks usually choose the same mate year after year.</p><p>Enjoy these fascinating animal facts?
