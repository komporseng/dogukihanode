They responded as follows when questioned about the first wedding:</p><p>We believed a Nashville ceremony with our families would be the perfect occasion for our families to get together because we had to be legally married in the United States before traveling to Mexico.</p><p>The wedded couple said that Hoover’s niece and nephew, as well as Eden’s niece, became great friends with the other family members.</p><p>“Our entire family, including Hilary’s niece and nephew, grew to love Brooke’s niece” (our flower girl and ring bearer). Family and friends have shown us so much love and support that we wanted to celebrate with everyone.</p><p>The outfit Brooke Eden chose was the same one Savin London had her pose in for the Love Inc. magazine cover. Consider the Wldflwrs, a Nashville-based ring provider who played a playlist of the best 1990s music throughout the wedding.</p><p>They provided the rings. A mother-daughter and father-daughter dance and a speech by Colbee, Eden’s niece, were next performed. The song Livin’ La Vida Loca, written and produced by Eden and Ricky Martin, was played as the pair danced.</p><h2><span id=Every_detail_about_Brooke_Eden_is_known>Every detail about Brooke Eden is known</span></h2><p>For the seventh and tenth seasons of American Idol, Brooke Eden gave auditions.

At nearby music festivals, she once served as the opening act for acts like Alan Jackson and Brooks & Dunn. She obtained her diploma from Wellington High School in 2007, and the following year she won the title of Miss South Florida in a local beauty competition.</p><p>Following her audition, Brooke was selected for the seventh season of American Idol.
