He was born in Nebraska in 1969. He went to Pawhuska High School there.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Was_In_A_Car_Accident_And_Lost_One_Of_His_Brothers>Ladd Was In A Car Accident And Lost One Of His Brothers</span></h2><p>Todd, one of Ladd’s brothers, was killed in a vehicle crash the summer before he was to go to college when he was eighteen.

Following the nuptials, the pair traveled to Australia. The couple lived on a rural working cattle ranch around eight miles west of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, after returning to the United States.

He Clearly Has More Money Than His Celebrity Wife.</span></h2><p>Ladd Drummond, a well-known blogger’s spouse and cattle rancher, is renowned for being wealthy, with estimates placing his net worth comfortably over $200 million. It seems that he is even wealthier than his more well-known spouse, who possessed assets of roughly $50 million.</p><p>The majority of Ladd’s riches came from inheritance from his forefathers; the Sun Devil, who is known for being rather proud, inherited a sizable number of properties.</p><p>In addition, as previously indicated, he and his brother Tim share ownership of the Drummond Land and Cattle Co.
