During the Convention of 1836, delegates approved a draft of the Texas Declaration of Independence, and the territory became its own nation. David Burnet was declared provisional president, and Sam Houston became the commander-in-chief of Texan forces. It wasn’t until 1845 that Texas would become part of the United States of America.</p><h2>1904: Dr. Seuss Is Born</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-403076 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dr-seuss.jpg alt="Dr. Seuss" width=800 height=851 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-403076 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><span class=caption-body>Dr. Seuss with his famous book The Cat in the Hat in 1957.</span></p><p>Children’s author Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr. Seuss</a>, is born in Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel first adopted the pen name “Dr. Seuss” while attending Dartmouth College, but he didn’t publish his first children’s book — And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street — until 1937 when he was 33 years old. Throughout his prolific career, Geisel wrote more than 60 books that are still adored by children across the world today.</p><h2>1917: Puerto Rico Becomes A U.S. Territory</h2><p>President Woodrow Wilson signs the Jones-Shafroth Act, making Puerto Rico a U.S. territory and granting American citizenship to Puerto Ricans. The bill recognized the island as an “organized but unincorporated” territory of the U.S. It also restructured Puerto Rico’s government, allowing it limited political autonomy.</p><h2>1955: Shoko Asahara Is Born</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-403079 alt="Shoko Asahara" width=900 height=720 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoko-asahara.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-403079 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wojtek Laski/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Shoko Asahara in 1994.</span></p><p>Shoko Asahara, the leader of the Japanese <a href=# rel=noopener>doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo</a>, is born to a poor family in Yatsushiro, Japan. He was reportedly a bully as a child, then began studying astrology, Taoism, and other religious concepts as an adult.</p><p>Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1987, and in 1995, members used sarin gas in an attack on the Tokyo subway system. Asahara was convicted of masterminding the plan that killed 12 people and injured thousands more — and was ultimately executed for his crimes in 2018.</p><h2>1998: Natascha Kampusch Is Kidnapped</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Natascha Kampusch</a> is kidnapped by Wolfgang Přiklopil in Austria. Pulled into a van while walking on the street, Kampusch spent the next 3,000 days in her abductor’s cellar. Kampusch used her empathy to relate to her abductor, gaining his trust by asking him for favors and affection. Eight years into her captivity, Kampusch was able to escape by running away from the property and calling for help. Before police could arrest Přiklopil, he committed suicide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wv6S0jGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
