Among them, Ikenna Ekwonna had viewers drooling right on the very first ep as he explained he need not work hard when it came to ladies.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, as Ikenna made his way into the villa to meet his paired partner, many viewers were turned off by his choice of footwear — a black croc! In disbelief, a fan tweeted, “Never has the disparity between men and women been more apparent than the girls in 4-inch heels and a guy wearing crocs.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, another added, “The only way Ikenna can live this down is if Crocs gives him a brand deal.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But then again, Ikenna never really cared “too much about what people think.” He can be young, wealthy, charming, and could still rock a comfy Crocs.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, this charming contestant considered himself to be confident and competitive! He wasn’t afraid to step on people’s toes if he had to. Well, a part of his confidence also came from his selection process — He was “plucked from the street” while on a trip to London by the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> crew.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Ikenna in the luxury Majorcan villa for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 2022 were his co-contestants — Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Afia Tonkmor, Amber Beckford, Luca Bish, Andrew La Page, Gemma Owen, Davide Sanclimenti, Tasha Ghouri, Dami Hope, Indiyah Polack, Liam Llewellyn, and Paige Thorne.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Missy Keating, Kat Harrison, Brad McDermott, Sophie Draper, Jordan Spencer, and Joshua Legrove were rumored to join the show in the latter half.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Promoting </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Ekwonna took it to his IG on May 30, 2022, to share, “The secret is out, catch our boy in the villa from June 6th.”</span></p><h3><b>Is Ikenna Ekwonna Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ikenna Ekwonna didn’t seem like he was dating anyone as of 2022.

Seeing this, many viewers took it to Indiyah’s IG to comment that she was mispaired.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Indiyah’s friends who were in charge of her account (then) defended them by responding, “‘Oh gosh y’all aren’t feeling it at all. But let’s remember to be mindful y’all, it’s the first episode and Ikenna looks like a sweetheart.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to Indiyah, Ikenna had only been in one past relationship. Infact, he had been single for three years, describing his love life as “turbulent.” Also, Ikenna revealed that he found it difficult to commit to one person, and admitted that on a night out, “things can get a bit messy.”</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Ikenna’s favorite body part on a girl is “the bunds” — “I need something to put my head on, to rest,” he explained.
