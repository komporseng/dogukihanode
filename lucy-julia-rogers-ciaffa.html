She co-starred with Rachel Miner, Mimi Rogers, Chad Todhunter, and Liz Davis.</p><p>She also appeared as Shayla Weinstein in the TV series “The Interns.” She shares the screen with Lukas Holland, Whitney Lyons, and Arienne Mandi.</p><p><strong>Following in the Footsteps of Her Parents</strong></p><p>Lucy, like Sacha Baron Cohen’s children, is the product of two renowned parents. Mimi, her mother, is a well-known American actress, professional poker player, and producer. Her father, on the other hand, is a producer and assistant director.</p><p>Mimi began her career in the 1980s and has appeared in over 50 films. She starred in films such as Lost in Space, The Surface, Captive, and Affairs of State.</p><p>Mimi has been in a number of TV episodes, including Mad Men, Two and a Half Men, The Loop, and NCIS, in addition to movies. She presently appears as Honey ‘Money’ Chandler in Amazon’s “Bosch.” Throughout her career, she has also appeared in over 25 TV movies.</p><p>Chris, Lucy’s father, is also no stranger to the entertainment industry. He has been a producer and assistant director for over two decades. He is well-known for his roles in films such as Unstoppable, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, and Doctor Mordrid. Lucy, like her parents, has been involved in show business since she was a child. She may have the genetics to be a successful actor, and we hope she does.</p><h2><span id=Lucy8217s_mother_was_previously_married>Lucy’s mother was previously married</span></h2><p>Mimi, like Pete Hegseth, has been married twice before. She finally met Lucy’s father after two failed marriages. Her first marriage occurred when she was barely 20 years old, to James Rogers. Their marriage lasted barely around four years before they separated in 1980.</p><p>Seven years after her divorce, the 63-year-old married Tom Cruise for the second time. The pair married on May 9, 1987, and divorced in 1990, over two years later. In 1990, she met and began dating her life partner Chris. Lucy was born in 1995, and the couple married in 2003.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jodie Comer Wiki: What’s Her Ethnicity?
