Bears lose their natural fear of humans, and humans forget that bears are unpredictable predators - a perfect formula for disaster.</p><p><h3 class=ih>NEVER RUN FROM A BEAR</h3></p><p class=dh>Though big and placid looking, bears are ferocious and voracious predators. Something that runs away - human or animal - becomes an irresistible prey and a bear will give chase. A human cannot outrun a bear who can match a racehorse's speed running downhill or uphill. If confronted by a bear, people are advised to step away sideways.</p><p class=dh>While getting away from a bear, people should remember that climbing a tree is not a good idea. Bears are excellent climbers.</p><p class=dh>Most bear/human interactions end amicably, as long as people follow the guidelines and treat the animals with respect and avoid confrontations with adults accompanied by cubs.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>In a related story</a>, a mother bear and her cubs turn a pool in a Rockaway Township, New Jersey backyard into their own private playground.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpncmxhaXq2utSsrJqkXZu5trLFsmSgrZWowbR5wpqjpWWUlratxYymmKerXZ28b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
