She claims that “the TPD officers involved were fully aware that Ms. Paris was suffering from a bipolar manic episode.

After that, the lady says it’s not a good idea. “Get away from me,” she says, before adding, “Why are you doing this?”</p><p>“I enjoy my job,” Carrocia says to another coworker, beaming. “It’ll be a lot of fun,” she predicts. Paris is arrested and jailed for a month after a third cop comes, breaks through the door, and pepper sprays him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cL7Op6WiZZOWv7O7wqKYZq6ZmbKwec6fZK2dkai2r7OMnJiun5iperC6jJumnbGTlrpw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
