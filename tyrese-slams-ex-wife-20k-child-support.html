Like, who spends that kind of money on a kid? [My daughter] was one when [Samantha] took my baby from me.</p><p>“We never spent $20,000 a month on our child and the credit card was wide open, so what the fuck do you suddenly need that kind of money for?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a lengthy caption attached to the social media video, the <a class=underline-link href=#>TGT</a> vocalist went into detail about how he’s made several attempts at pushing back against the legal proceedings that he is convicted have been biased against him thus far.</p><p>Check it out below:</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Tyrese is currently requesting a new judge in his ongoing divorce case</a>, suggesting that the one currently presiding over it is prejudiced against him. According to a TMZ report last week, he filed a motion in court alleging Judge Kevin M. Farmer abruptly canceled a hearing that would have allowed him to tell his side of the story before having to fork over a $450,000 bond.</p><p>Instead, he was ordered to come up with the six-figure sum in just 10 days.

Days before a court hearing earlier this year (the results of which he was trying to appeal with this latest court date), <a class=underline-link href=#>he blasted the judge for being “racist” and accused him of calling his ex-wife a “bitch”</a> in the private chambers of his office. He also accused the judge of illegally sealing the case to cover up his own misconduct.</p><p>“We tried to get him recused, we tried to get him thrown off the bench because of his conduct and his unprofessionalism. And then there were a bunch of things pertaining to the outcome of my case that he did that was literally illegal,” Tyrese said in an Instagram post.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tyrese and Farmer’s issues date back to last August, when <a class=underline-link href=#>the Fulton County jurist threatened to hold him in contempt of court</a> for arguing with his ex-wife’s lawyer over his earnings.
