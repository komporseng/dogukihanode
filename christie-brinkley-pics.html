As the face of CoverGirl for 25 years, Christie became synonymous with beauty and glamour. She gained worldwide fame in 1979 by gracing the cover of the ‘Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue,’ a feat she would repeat in 1980 and 1981. Before then, no model had appeared on two consecutive covers, and Christie pulled off the three-peat. She has appeared on over 500 magazine covers, in countless campaigns and on numerous runways. Her work as a model led to her giving acting a try. She had notable roles in ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation,’ on “Mad About You,’ and on ‘Parks and Recreation.’ She also acted on stage, making her debut in 2011 as Roxie Hart in ‘Chicago.’ She also has a notable role in Billy Joel’s ‘Uptown Girl’ music video, as the two were married from 1985 to 1994. The two had one child, Alexa Ray Joel. As of 2019, she was married four times – to French artist Jean-François Allaux, to Billy Joel, to real estate developer Richard Taubman, and to architect Peter Halsey Cook. She and Richard had a boy, Jack Paris Brinkley Taubman, while she and Peter welcomed Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook in 1998.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLCpvsisq6KdXZe%2FqrrKpZyyZaCesLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
