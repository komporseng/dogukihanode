Mother, Movies & TV Shows</a></strong></span></p><p><span>At first, they kept a secret about their relationship but later on the 2013 New Year’s Day, Todd revealed about their relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And on 14th April 2016, they tied their knot in Atlanta. The couple shared the whole ceremony of their marriage with their fans. Just after their marriage, Kandi shared how she&nbsp;<a href=#>felt about her husband</a>. She said:</span></p><p><strong><span>“This is one of the best days of my life I never imagined that I would marry my best friend. Todd’s been that to me. And to have just had the wedding of my dreams, it’s all been so beautiful. Now it’s time to party!”</span></strong></p><p><span>Since a couple shared all about their relationship with their fans, now we know one of their&nbsp;<a href=#>marriage secrets</a>. Once Todd leaked it through Instagram, where he posted writing,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>"Chase her. Even when she's already yours,"&nbsp;</strong>with the caption&nbsp;<strong>“Let’s go”.</strong>&nbsp;In the post, Kandi only commented with heart emoji. But later, she replied through the post on Instagram, captioning,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>"The chase is still on [and] I love it! I love you [Todd]."</span></strong></p><p><span>After marriage, the couple has two children. The first child is their son, Ace Well, born on 6th January 2016, and the second child is their daughter, Blaze, who was born through surrogate mother on 22nd November.</span></p><p><span><strong>You May Like:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Kandi Burruss Opens About Breasts Reduction Surgery On YouTube Series 'Body Work' - Net Worth And House Details</a></strong></span></p><p><span>But they were&nbsp;<a href=#>feeling guilt over surrogate</a>&nbsp;as she said:</span></p><p><strong><span>"We just didn't really know about how much communication we should have. ... I [didn't] want to seem annoying. But she always made us feel at ease.</span></strong></p><p><span>The reality star also added:</span></p><p><strong><span>She always let us know that we never called too much [and] never was bothered by us reaching out. She always volunteered information — she's like, 'Oh, I'm feeling a bump today,' or 'Oh, this happened.'&nbsp;"&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Todd shared a picture of&nbsp;<a href=#>pregnant Kand</a>i on Instagram, captioning,&nbsp;</span><span><strong>"Another addition to the family babe?"</strong>&nbsp;in which Kandi was in a black shapewear bodysuit with white ankle socks, holding her belly.</span></p><p><span>Altogether, they have&nbsp;<a href=#>four children</a>&nbsp;as both of them have children from a previous marriage. Their eldest child is Todd Tucker’s daughter, Kaela, who was born on 17th June 1996. And the second eldest child is Kandi’s daughter, Rilley Burruss, born on 22nd August.
