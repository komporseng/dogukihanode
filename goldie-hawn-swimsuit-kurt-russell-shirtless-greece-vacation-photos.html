Although they’ve never gotten married, they’ve remained a strong, powerful Hollywood duo throughout their relationship. Kurt and Goldie continued to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defend their decision</a> not to walk down the aisle in a March 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety.</a> Kurt explained that they simply never cared to put a title on their relationship, and neither did their children (Goldie had two kids before getting together with Kurt, and he had one son. They went on to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have a son</a>, <strong>Wyatt</strong>, together, as well).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Goldie-Hawn-Swimsuit-Greece-Kurt-Russell-MEGA-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“A lasting relationship isn’t about marriage,” Goldie explained in a separate 2015 interview with Porter magazine. “It’s about compatibility and communication. And you both need to want it to work. If one person does not want it to work, it isn’t going to work. Intention is the key.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The two met while filming&nbsp;The One And Only Genuine, Original Family Band in 1966. However, it wasn’t until they teamed up again to film&nbsp;Swing Shift in 1983 that they took their romance off screen. Part of what makes their relationship work so well, though, is how low-key they both are. “Kurt and I are very similar,” Goldie admitted in the&nbsp;Variety interview. “He doesn’t consider himself a movie star. Nor do I. Neither one of us walks around thinking about that stuff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BsZqCnnJm2pnnHmq6nZaOstq6%2F1KKrZqOlp8FuvtSsqp6knGLAqbXRraOeq6NitLOxxJycZq6RmK61tc6nZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
