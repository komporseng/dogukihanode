The shoot is based on Takusatsu, which is a Japanese style of live-action cinema. It is in other words, exaggerated, over the top, and full of practical effects, which was the theme of the cover. Coolidge can be seen dressed up in multiple outfits, comprising a lime green coat with sequin polka dots and a dress with a funny oversized bow to top it, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'I'm beyond myself about Jennifer Coolidge': Reese Whiterspoon says there's no 'Legally Blonde 3' without 'gifted' co-star</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Everything Everywhere All At Once' bagged 5 Critics Choice Awards this season</a></p><h2 class=split>What is Tokusatsu?</h2><p>"Tokusatsu is so well done, but the special effects are always kind of handmade. If you look at the stuff from the '60s, you can feel the fingerprint. You can tell there's somebody inside the costume. There's something very charming about that, especially nowadays, when you can create anything digitally and nothing impresses you anymore," revealed Kwan. Coolidge had a sporty take on her unique photo shoot, "The film business tires people out. But I swear to god, I felt like I was getting together with little kids. They were like these sort of child prodigies who are super, super smart and just super creative."</p><h2 class=split>'I have weapons, take down small cities, pick up cars'</h2><p>The 61-year-old actress went on, “I've never been asked to do a shoot like this: I have weapons, take down small cities, pick up cars and throw them. I don't know if I will ever be this surprised again. It was one of the best things I have ever been involved in." Talking more on the theme of the shoot for the magazine’s special edition, Scheinert said, "There is so much pressure around Everything Everywhere All at Once, so our impulse for this shoot was to do the opposite. Not only do I really just want to dress up as a monster—I want to get our friends together, play with cardboard props, and go out to the desert."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWju6qyxKtknKefobals8Rmq66qnqh6qrrTqGSaZaOqvaa%2Bx56pqGWWpL9usdWeqbKsmJ67qHnEr5yrsaedsrOxjJqjpWWRqXqwusKeZKaZl5bHqrrEZpqorpWn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
