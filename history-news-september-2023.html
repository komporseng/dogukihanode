Recently, we’ve covered the discovery of an unknown World War II-era tunnel beneath Saxon Palace in Poland, how archaeologists uncovered Bronze Age remains with brains and hair still intact in Turkey, the unearthing of a 2,600-year-old child’s shoe in an Austrian salt mine, how construction workers in China damaged a portion of the Great Wall in search of a shortcut, and the study of a Bronze Age girl’s macabre burial in Kazakhstan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For starters, she was buried with with 180 ankle bones from sheep or cattle, as well as three cows’ shoulder blades, multiple metal pommels, a mirror, a bronze bowl, and a small bronze disc carved with the depiction of a frog.</p><p>Archaeologists aren’t entirely sure what the grave goods mean. The animal bones may have been part of a cult practice or simply “symbols of well-being.” The frog is even more baffling, though archaeologists have speculated that it may be associated with women in labor or “the cult of water.”</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-451340 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/frog-disc.jpg alt="Bronze Age Frog Disc From Kazakhstan" width=900 height=507 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-451340 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Kazakh Ministry of Science and Higher Education</span><span class=caption-body>The frog disc is the first of its kind to be found in Kazakhstan.</span></p><p>There were also a number of historical anniversaries that we covered including Japan’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Great Kanto Earthquake</a> on September 1, 1923, the death of J.R.R. Tolkien on September 2, 1973, the <a href=# rel=noopener>founding of Google</a> on September 4, 1998, the death of <a href=# rel=noopener>Johnny Cash</a> on September 12, 2003, the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs dubbed the “Battle of the Sexes” on September 20, 1973, and the moment when a Soviet colonel named <a href=# rel=noopener>Stanislav Petrov</a> stopped possible nuclear armageddon on September 26, 1983.</p><p>Petrov was working at a secret command center for the Soviet Air Defense Forces when an alarm suddenly went on. It appeared, according to the computers, that the United States had just launched five ballistic missiles at the Soviet Union. Petrov had to make a quick decision about whether to retaliate and, fortunately, he decided that it was probably a false alarm. His decision not to fire Soviet missiles at the U.S. likely saved the world from a nuclear catastrophe.</p><p>“I had a funny feeling in my gut,” he later explained. “I didn’t want to make a mistake. I made a decision, and that was it… when people start a war, they don’t start it with only five missiles.”</p><p class=.post-content>Learn more about the <a href=#>music</a> used in our podcast.
