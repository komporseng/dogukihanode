According to the Pennsylvania State Police, a Subaru belonging to Phyllis Potter, who is 85 years old and lives in Westfield, was found on Sunday in the vicinity of a cornfield off of North Fork Road in Brookfield Township.</p><p>Phyllis Potter lives in Westfield. Within a short distance of the vehicle, the skeletal remains of a human person were found. Since the police have announced that an autopsy will be performed, they will not be able to confirm whether or not the remains belong to Potter until after the autopsy has been completed. Potter was last seen by a member of the public on the 21st of July, and his disappearance was reported on the 22nd of the same month.</p><p>Since that time, there have been a great number of searches carried out all across Tioga County by people from the community as well as officers from the local law enforcement. The vehicle that belonged to Potter was already in the process of being removed from the scene when the reporter for WENY arrived there on Sunday afternoon. Saturday brought the discovery of Potter’s vehicle, but according to the organizers who were involved in the search activities, there was no sign of the missing woman inside the vehicle.</p><p>On Sunday morning, the operations that had been halted due to the darkness were resumed where they had left off. This is an absolutely brand-new piece of news that just came out. There is now a reporter from WENY News present at the scene; additional details will be provided once they have been verified.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvMeyo6Who2K9sMDTnqlmpZmowKq6xmannqqjpLtuw8Ssq5%2BhlaGxbrzEp6WssZyrrq%2B1wGafrqWRo3qzscyaoKerXZu8trrDZqCnZaCdxq24yKxkqaekqbKzecKaqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
