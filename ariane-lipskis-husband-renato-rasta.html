She started training Muay Thai and became the Brazilian Muay Thai champion prior to her MMA transition. Lipski debuted under Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki’s (KSW) promotion. Lipski had a good start for her MMA career at KSW and was named The Queen of Violence. Unfortunately, the fighter’s deal with KSW came to an end, with her MMA record being 11-3. The fighter expressed her sadness through a post on Instagram.</p><p>Later, Ariane revealed her signing with UFC. She was excited to start a new journey. Unfortunately, her first bout with UFC got canceled because her opponent <strong>Maryna Moroz&nbsp;</strong>pulled out due to injury. Two months later, on January 19, 2019, Lipski faced <strong>Joanne Calderwood</strong> for her UFC debut but lost the fight via unanimous decision. After that, Lipski faced two consecutive losses at UFC before getting a taste of her first win against <strong>Isabela de Pádua</strong>. Her record is 14-8-0 as of January 2023.</p><p>Ariane Lipski’s next match is scheduled on March 11, 2023. She is to face <strong>JJ Aldrich </strong>at UFC Fight Night 221.

He was born on June 26, 1983, in Curitiba, Brazil. He first debuted in 2012 and held a Pro-MMA record of 5-3-0. Rasta’s last fight was on July 20, 2018. He is now active as a coach to his wife, Ariane, and can be seen as a cornerman during her bouts.</p><p>Renato also has a son named <strong>Renan Silva</strong>, who is allegedly from his past relationship. For many years, Ariane and Renato’s relationship was named to be only a professional one. However, Lipski finally revealed her romantic relationship with her coach through an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">adorable post</a> of the duo on her Instagram in 2017. They have been together ever since and are now happily married.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lipskis_Love_Story></span>Lipski’s Love Story<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple’s journey dates way back. These two are an example of growing together through thick and thin. They met in 2013 when Lipski went to Renato’s gym, asking him to train her to become a fighter. Together, they overcame a lot of struggles to reach where they are today. And with each passing year, they grew closer.</p><p>After years of being together, the couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in 2019. Unlike others, they did not share any pictures or news regarding their wedding. At their first wedding anniversary, the fighter took to her Instagram to wish her husband Renato a happy first year of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ariane-Lipski-Married-Life.jpg><p>The couple likes to keep things private and to themselves. But they can be seen together on each other’s Instagram frequently. We wish them all lifetime of togetherness and look forward to Lipski’s win in the next match on March 11, 2023, after her last upset with <strong>Priscila Cachoeira</strong>.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcK3RopinnV2htrG%2FyqKqZqClqK%2BiusNmqZ6mkam8br7ArKuaZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
